# Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered Profile

> [!WARNING]  
> **This profile could be inaccurate.**
> 
> There's no real unique element in the loading screens, so I had to use the bottom left corner, including a small part of the loading bar.  
> There may be **false positives**, and when the loading bar is **below ~3%, it won't get detected**.

Reference configuration:

- On Monitor 1
- Fullscreen
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- I recommend to use Proton 9 [to fix issues](https://www.protondb.com/app/2561580#kSPEEkCyjg) with Fullscreen & hangups on focus loss
